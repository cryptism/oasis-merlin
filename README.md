# oasis-merlin: let OASIS manage your .merlin file
oasis-merlin is a plugin for OASIS which aims to avoid having to manage your .merlin file by hand.

This currently is not working for any supported version of OASIS pending this bug: [https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail]

which we hope should be fixed in 0.4.8.
